# fuelwatch-pwa

A simple React App that pulls in fuel price data from [FuelWatch](https://www.fuelwatch.wa.gov.au/fuelwatch/pages/home.jspx) and displays the data on a map.

Since FuelWatch only has an XML feed I thought this would be a fun project to create a simple GraphQL API with the help of [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) and a custom REST data source.

You can view the API here: https://fuelwatch.leighkendell.now.sh/api and the React app here: https://fuelwatch.leighkendell.now.sh/
